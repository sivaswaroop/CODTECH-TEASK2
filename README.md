### objective
- The objective of this project is to preform PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION on a HOUSING dataset and Random dataset.
- In HOUSING dataset containing PRICE and MEDINC.
- In RANDOM dataset we have use random numbers.
- The aim is to uncover insights into correlations,and showing Linear Regression.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**:The primary programming language for data analysis
- **Pandas**:Used for Data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**:Employed for creatinng static,animated and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**:Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.
- **linear regression**:Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.
- **sklearn**:scikit-learn is a free and open-source machine learning library for the Python programming language.
- **train_split_test**:Split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets.
